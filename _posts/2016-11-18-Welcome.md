I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the [biostatistics department](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health where I am super fortunate to work with a ton of great people in [Jeff Leek's group](http://jtleek.com/). 

I can be best reached by email at sellis18 at jhmi dot edu, but you can also find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Shannon_E_Ellis), or likely in my office (JHSPH E3011).

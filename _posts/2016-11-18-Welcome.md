I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the [biostatisticss department](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health where I am super fortunate to work with a ton of great people in [Jeff Leek's group](http://jtleek.com/). 

### The <recount> project
RNA-seq data for ~70,000 human samples have been aligned using a single analytic pipeline called [Rail-RNA](http://rail.bio/), developed and implemented by [Abhi Nellore's](https://twitter.com/AbhiNellore). Spearheaded by [Leo Collado-Torres] (http://lcolladotor.github.io/about.html#.WC8cpKIrIdU) and including the efforts of many in our group, these data have been processed and made available in a resource called [recount](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/). While the expression data are publicly available, critical phenotype information is missing for a number of the samples included in this resource. I'm working to (1) identify technical artifacts to be removed within these dats and to (2) build phenotype predictors from the gene expression data to make important sample information availabe across all samples within <recount>.

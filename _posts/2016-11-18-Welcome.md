I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the [biostatistics department](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) where I am super fortunate to work with a ton of great people in [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/)'s group. 

I can be best reached by email at **sellis18 at jhmi dot edu**, but you can also find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Shannon_E_Ellis) or in my office (**JHSPH E3011**).

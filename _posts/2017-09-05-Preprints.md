title: Let there be preprint citations!

Historically, in the biological sciences, deference has been solely given to peer-reviewed publications. This meant that when writing new manuscripts, there was only ever a need to reference peer-reviewed and published manuscripts. With the explosion in popularity (for really great reasons!) of preprint servers, like [bioRxiv](http://www.biorxiv.org/), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), and [peerJ preprints](https://peerj.com/preprints/) (among others), I think it's time we take a look at our current citation model.  

The [NIH recently ruled](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-050.html) to allow [preprints to be referenced in grant proposals](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/nih-enables-investigators-include-draft-preprints-grant-proposals). This shift comes on the heels of a larger shift valuing quicker dissemtination of information. While the debate has been settled for now in grants, I have heard little discussion about **how to handle preprint references in peer-reviewed manuscripts**.

To me, the solution seems simple. **Preprints should be allowed to be cited in peer-reviewed manuscripts.** This would allow for the quickest dissemination of information, credit to be given where credit is due, and readers to have access to the most recent findings. I simultaneously argue that **there is value in the peer-review process**. Accordingly, there must be some simple way in manuscripts to *differentiate between preprint and peer-reviewed references*. 

To differentiate clearly but unobtrusively in in-text citations journals could simply use numbers for peer-reviewed literature (as is typically done currently) and letters for preprints. For example:

<blockquote>

<span style="font-family:courier;">If your sentence is referencing a peer-reviewed paper, the citation would be as always [1].</span><br><br>

<span style="font-family:courier;">However, when you want to reference a preprint, maybe the citation would simply be a capital letter [A].</span>
</blockquote>


This model would then allow for separation in the references section. First, a section for the numbers (peer-reviewed research). Then a section for the letters (preprints). For example:

<blockquote>
<span style="font-family:courier;"><strong>References</strong></span><br><br>

<span style="font-family:courier;"><strong>Peer-Reviewed Research</strong></span> <br> 
<span style="font-family:courier;">1. Granger, Hermione. Title. <em>Journal</em>. August 11, 2017.</span><br>   
<span style="font-family:courier;">2. Kringle, Kris. Title. <em>Journal</em>. Dec 25, 2016.</span> <br><br>

<span style="font-family:courier;"><strong>Preprints</strong></span><br>  
<span style="font-family:courier;">A. Quimby, Ramona. Title. <em>Preprint Journal</em>. August 11, 2017 [cited 2017 Sep 12]. www.url.to.preprint/####.</span><br>  
<span style="font-family:courier;">B. Prince, Diana. Title. <em>Preprint Journal</em>. September 4, 2017 [cited 2016 Sep 5]. www.url.to.preprint/####.}</span><br>
</blockquote>

Okay, so we've got a suggested update to the old model. What about problems that may arise as a result of these suggestions. Here are a few with some possible solution...

**Problem #1**: Some journals' in-text citations include the authors' name and publication year, rather than a numeric: [Ellis et al, 2017]  
**Solution #1**: If it is a preprint being referenced, maybe a simple superscript would do the trick: [Ellis et al., 2017<sup>P</sup>], where P denotes preprint.

**Problem #2**: Preprints often become peer-reviewed research. How will we keep track?  
**Solution #2a** (if this occurs during while the *manuscript is being drafted*): It is up to the author(s) to ensure that their manuscript is as up to date as possible upon submission for publication.\*   
**Solution #2b** (if this occurs during while the manuscript is *under review*): Yup. Still the authors' responsibility\*, but a reminder or tool to ensure accuracy from the publisher would be more than welcome.  
**Solution #2c** (if this occurs *post-publication*): If the preprint was cited and it later goes through peer review, that does not matter. You cited the preprint. You meant to reference the preprint.  
\*I currently use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to track citations, but I would certainly switch my source manager to whichever best handles this new model should it be implemented. The citation manager that seamlessly identifies manuscripts that have since been peer-reviewed and has the capability to update my in-text citations and references section accordingly will gain a user....unless of course that manager is Zotero, in which case they keep a user!

As we move forward to a world that increasingly values preprints, we must be able to reference preprints in manuscripts. While preprints are wonderful, the peer-review process is also valuable, and references in manuscripts must differentiate between the two. Finally, going forward, a system that detects when preprints have been peer-reviewed and updates citations and references in manuscripts accordingly will be invaluable.

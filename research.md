I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the [biostatistics department](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) where I am super fortunate to work with a ton of great people in [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/)'s group. 

### The *recount* project

RNA-seq data for ~70,000 human samples have been aligned using a single analytic pipeline called [Rail-RNA](http://rail.bio/), developed and implemented by [Abhi Nellore](https://twitter.com/AbhiNellore). Spearheaded by [Leo Collado-Torres](http://lcolladotor.github.io/about.html#.WC8mXaIrIdU) and including the efforts of many in our group, these data have been processed and made available in a resource called *[recount](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/)*. While the expression data are publicly available, we lack critical phenotype information for many of the samples included in this resource. In addition to identifying technical artifacts to be removed across these data, I'm developing phenotype predictors (ie sex, tissue, etc.) from the gene expression data to make important sample information availabe across all samples within recount.

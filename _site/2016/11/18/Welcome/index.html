  <h1 class="post-title">Leek Group Colors!</h1>
  <p>Let me start off by being clear. We are by <em>no means</em> the first people to ask <a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/">which</a> <a href="https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson">color</a> <a href="https://github.com/dill/beyonce">palettes</a> are best for graphing. Further, I fully admit that we entered into this quickly and did not read the literature throroughly nor think through <em>all</em> the possibilities that one should consider when embarking upon a proper research project. Which, to be fair, is why this is a blog post (and not a paper).</p>

<p>We probably aren’t even the first mentor and mentee to have the following <del>argument</del> discussion:&lt;/br&gt;
<strong>Shannon</strong>: Well, and this is not a sexist comment, males don’t differentiate colors as well as females.&lt;/br&gt;
<strong>Jeff</strong>: What? Yes, that is sexist!&lt;/br&gt;
<strong>Shannon</strong>: No, it’s not. It’s a thing.&lt;/br&gt;
<strong>Jeff</strong>: Are you sure?&lt;/br&gt;
<strong>Shannon</strong>: I think so…&lt;/br&gt;
<strong>Jeff</strong>: Let’s test it.&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>But, alas, the desires to (<strong>1</strong>) develop a “Leek Group” color palette and plotting style and (<strong>2</strong>) determine whether or not males and females discriminate colors equally well were born.</p>

<p>And, so, we asked the internet to take a <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/rKbea6EWKxFdNpOw2">quiz</a>.</p>

<p>###Quiz Participants
After removing duplicate responses, keeping only the most recent response from any one individual (nice try, you guys!), we had <strong>426 responses</strong> from <strong>198 females (46.0%)</strong>, <strong>219 Males (51.8%)</strong>, <strong>1 nonbinary individual (0.2%)</strong>, and <strong>7 people who preferred not to say (1.6%)</strong>.</p>

<p>###Color Palettes
To remind those who took the quiz and catch the rest of you who didn’t up to speed, these were the color palettes being considered:</p>

<p>###Results</p>

<p>####Color Palette Preference
There was no <em>overwhelmingly popular</em> winner; however, the “bright” palette was preferred by the largest proportion of people for both graphing generally (green below) and specifically when applied to the boxplot (purple) and network (orange) figures presented. In group meeting, it was suggested that the pink be “more pink,” and I thought that was a great suggestion, so, without further adieu, the Leek Group color palette will be “bright” (<em>with slight pink adjustments</em>).</p>

<p>As for the other plotting details for Leek Group graphs, you’ll just have to wait on the edge of your seats and see what <a href="http://seankross.com/">Sean</a> comes up with!</p>

<p>####Color Preferences by Sex
Now…onto defending my honor.</p>

<p>First, when asked to select palettes in which all the colors included did not appear distinct at first glance, 25% of females and only 8.7% of males responded that all of the palettes appeared reasonably distinct (p&lt;5e-05). Yes! Point Shannon.</p>

<p>However, when presented with three images of blue dots and asked the correct number of distinct colors in each image, we got the following results:</p>

<p>Note: the actual number of distinct colors is 5, 7, and 7 respectively.</p>

<p>As made evident in the graphs above, there is no large effect here. To break these results down anyway, in the middle image, I’ll note there was a tendency for females to get the correct answer (7). However, this effect is attenuated in graph to the right in which more males see the correct number of distinct colors (7) and more females see more distinct colors than are actually there (8 and 9…¯\_(ツ)_/¯?). I’ll concede to Jeff on this portion of the experiment that, in our experiment, there was no strong effect for color discrimination between males and females. Point Jeff.</p>

<p>Finally, while not about color discrimination, we did see sex preferences when broken down by color palette. Specifically, females showed the strongest preference (relative to males) for “bright””, “electric””, and “google”” to males. Males, on the other hand had a preference for “spring” and “summer” relative to females.</p>

<p>###Limitations
-colorblindness</p>
<ul>
  <li>color palettes could have been chosen differntly</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>“i tried to do your google form about colors and i just ended up hating myself halfway through so i stopped”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>###Discussion</p>
<ul>
  <li>academic males</li>
  <li>people have personal preferences</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, thanks to everyone who was interested enough in colors or bored enough scrolling through social media to take our quiz and a special thanks to <a href="http://alyssafrazee.com/">Alyssa Frazee</a>, from whom I absolutely stole code from <a href="https://github.com/alyssafrazee/RSkittleBrewer">RSkittleBrwerR</a> to generate the color palette images on the quiz.</p>

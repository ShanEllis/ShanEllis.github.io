title: About

I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [biostatistics department](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) where I am super fortunate to work with a ton of great people in [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/)'s group. 

Before joining Jeff, I received my Ph.D. in human genetics from the [Institute of Genetic Medicine](https://igm.jhmi.edu/) at the Johns Hopkins Univeristy School of Medicine.  In [Dan Arking's lab](http://www.arkinglab.org/) I focused on improving our understanding of autism. To do this, I used post-morem cortical brain samples from autism cases and controls to study alterations in [gene expression]() and [methylation](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/15/069120).  
   
Since starting with Jeff in July 2016, I've been working with the data in *[recount](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/)* to build phenotype predictors capable of accurately predicting tissue, sex, and age. Additionally, I'll be working to identify technical artifacts within these data and removing their effects, allowing for accurate downstream analysis.

Regarding my research interests, I'm interested in analyzing human data carefully. I *really* like pristine data sets. However, biology and experiments are messy. Fortunately, I also really enjoy digging into and untangling the mess that often results from large genomic data set generation. So, if there's a human genomic data set and an interesting biological question, I'm probably interested.

When I'm not analyzing data, cursing myself for a bug in my code, or writing about these endeavors, I harbor reasonable obsessions for beach volleyball, [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), baking, podcasts, and riding my bike all around Baltimore.

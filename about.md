I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the [biostatistics department](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) where I am super fortunate to work with a ton of great people in [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/)'s group.

Since starting with Jeff in July 2016, I've been working with the data in *[recount](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/)* to build phenotype predictors capable of accurately predicting tissue, sex, and age. I have begun to use the predictions to improve analyses and better understand expression in humans.

Before joining Jeff, I received my Ph.D. in human genetics from the [Institute of Genetic Medicine](https://igm.jhmi.edu/) at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  In [Dan Arking's lab](http://www.arkinglab.org/) I focused on improving our understanding of autism. To do this, I used post-mortem cortical brain samples from autism cases and controls to study alterations in [gene expression](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6748) and [methylation](https://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13229-017-0119-y).  
   
Regarding my research interests, I'm interested in analyzing human data carefully. I *really* like pristine data sets. However, biology and experiments are messy. Fortunately, I also really enjoy digging into and untangling the mess that often results from large genomic data set generation. So, if there's a human genomic data set and an interesting biological question, I'm probably interested.

When I'm not analyzing data, cursing myself for a bug in my code, or writing about these endeavors, I harbor reasonable obsessions for beach volleyball, [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), baking, podcasts, and riding my bike all around Baltimore.

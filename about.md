title: About Me

I  finished up my Ph.D. in human genetics with [Dan Arking](http://www.arkinglab.org/) in the [Institute of Genetic Medicine](https://igm.jhmi.edu/) at the Johns Hopkins Univeristy School of Medicine in June of 2016. My graduate work focused on improving our understanding of the basis of autism. To do this, I used post-morem cortical brain samples from autism cases and controls to study alterations in [gene expression]() and [methylation](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/15/069120).

As my interests lay in genomic data analysis, I began a postdoc with [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/) in July of 2016. Since starting, I've been working with the data in *[recount](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/)* to build phenotype predictors capable of accurately predicting tissue, sex, and age. Additionally, I'll be working to identify technical artifacts within these data and removing their effects, allowing for accurate downstream analysis.  

Regarding my research interests, I'm interested in analyzing human data carefully. I *really* like pristine data sets. However, biology and experiments are messy. Fortunately, I also really enjoy digging into and untangling the mess that often results from large genomic data set generation. So, if there's a human genomic data set and an interesting biological question, I'm probably interested.

When I'm not analyzing data, cursing myself for a bug in my code, or writing about these endeavors, I harbor reasonable obsessions for beach volleyball, [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), baking, podcasts, and riding my bike all around Baltimore.
